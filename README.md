# backupcrisiscsv
A little script to backup a CSV on a crisis website. In case website is unavailable

Years later comments - The story behind the script is quite interesting. Several hurricanes had hit the United States. I was contacted by some volunteer groups to backup some data from a crisis relief website that was administering relief effort data. Not having enough time for a thorough backup method, I produced this selenium script to do the job.
